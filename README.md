# Find tourist theme of a country

This project was done as part of Masters curriculum which involved finding own and useful real life use case to apply machine learning.

The use case was to find the tourism theme of a country.

The input to the system were images collected from  social networking site. Training images were obtained by searching using hashtags #{theme_name}.

Fixed themes such as architecture, beach, desert, wildlife, winter-landscape were selected and used as labels. The problem of finding tourist theme was reduced to supervised image classification problem with test image as a image of a country.

Random forest was used as classification method which gave a modest performance of ~50 %. The performance can be improved by removing noisy images from the training data.

# Dependencies

Python 2.7

scikit-learn: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html

cartopy: conda install -c scitools cartopy

# Usage

Run preprocess_images_countries.py to pre-process images of countries in "Countries" folder.

Run preprocess_images_themes.py to pre-process images of themes "Themes" folder.

Run ml_svm.py to analyse the performance of dimensionality reduction and SVM on the data.

Run ml_random_forest.py to analyse the performance of Random forests on the data and also visualise tourism theme output on world map.

PCA, SVM and Random Forest are done using scikit-learn machine learning library.
